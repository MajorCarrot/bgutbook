# Day 10 - Sorting and reducing

Sorting data is paramount in so many cases. We sort data to ease the visual browsing, to pick the top entries according to some quantity, or to spot duplicates. Needless to say, Unix provides a specific tool for sorting, which is unsurprisingly called `sort`.

So, we are hackers, we pose as the keepers of deep and powerful knowledge about computers, and we go around sorting things with a command called `sort`? We definitely have to come up with some command with an obscure and meaningless name! Oh, wait, there are `grep` and `sed`, but we will discuss about them in a later lesson.

For the time being, let's spend some time with the self-explanatory `sort`. Since sorting is so simple and straightforward, `sort` is a command with... only 30 possible options. Well, it turns out simple things are many times not so simple! I will show you only a couple of these options, the ones I happend to use the most, but always remember that you can read the man page and discover new useful ones.

For starters, let's use the bare command

``` sh
cat TODO | sort
```
