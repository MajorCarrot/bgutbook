# The Unix terminal without pain

Learn bash and the Unix core utilities in a relaxed way

This is the repository with the source code of the book "", published by Leanpub. You can download the book for free [here](https://leanpub.com/TODO) or contribute purchasing it.

This repository can be use to submit issues, if you found any reading the book, or to ask for clarifications. Feel free to use the [issues page](https://github.com/TODO), there are also some labels you can use.

The source of the book is in the `source` directory, while the `manuscript` directory used by Leanpub is created by the simple script named `run.sh` for lack of a better name. I went for this solution as the Markua support for exercises is buggy and limited, and I strongly wanted to avoid repeating the text of the exercises.
