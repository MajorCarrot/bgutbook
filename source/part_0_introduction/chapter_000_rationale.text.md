# Why this book exists

When I decided to write this book I was working on a series of short workshops for my junior colleagues. I hadn't worked with juniors for many years, and while I was perfectly conscious that some people didn't grow up with a command line, practically speaking I was assuming that they knew what I did, which is probably a mistake that many advanced programmers make.

So, I decided to run some sessions in which we discovered together the bash shell, starting from the simplest commands up to some proper scripting. I was rewarded (and I still am) by a lot of satisfied smiles when they finally got the right sequence of pipes or when they discovered regular expressions. From those sessions, and from the notes that I wrote to prepare them, I had the idea of a book that could be easily followed, maybe in one's spare time, as nowadays it's always very complex for people to find time to study big tomes.

I usually avoid trying to be funny when writing or speaking in English; it's not my native language, so I lack the vocabulary and the comedic timing. But a thing that I learned many years ago is that a laugh helps people to remember what was said, so this time I decided to try with a light-hearted approach. I hope this will ease the read and make your journey into the Unix world more comfortable.

If it doesn't work, I apologise in advance. you can always go and get some ancient tome of dark magic like "The Unix Bible". I'm pretty sure you will remember for years the moment in which you'll manage to conjure some sort of multitentacular Lovecraftian horror, but I'm not sure this will have a significant impact on your career. If we exclude the fact that it will probably put an end to it, obviously.

# Why you should read this book

If you are a programmer, nowadays you probably got in touch with Open Source software, with version control system like Git, with cloud services like AWS, with some dynamic language like Python or Ruby. What do all these things have in common? Many things probably, but one of them is definitely that they are rooted in the Unix world. [^win]

[^win]: Sure, you can have all these things in your Windows laptop (Windows is not a Unix-like operating system), but I can't recommend it. I mean, you bought a water pistol, and you want to use it with real bullets. Good luck!

That of Unix is a rich world, and this book will not even scratch the surface. but one of the most powerful things Unix systems have is the command line. Yes, in 2019, with AIs constantly processing everything we search and do online, mobile phones with perfect user interfaces, and proper virtual reality around the corner, the good old green-on-black terminal still has something to say. Actually more than something!

The command line is a tool that I think will never get too old to be useful. I am happy when the GUI of some program is simple and well designed, but there is simply nothing that can give you more power than the command line.

So, long story short, you should definitely learn at least the fundamentals of the command line!
